# Final Project Planning

### What program are we going to create? Use your brainstorming from the solo checkpoint to answer this question together.

- The program we're going to create is a Fighter Plane Game:
The game occurs all the time on the air. There appear several random enemies to shoot the player and search to destroy it.

### What technologies will we use? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to remind yourselves of the language, libraries, and anything else you plan on using.

- We are going to use python 3.9 and the arcade library. The arcade library is for creating a window with sprites that update dynamically. We will use Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Microsoft Paint to create the visual assets.

### What features will we include? The goal of asking this question is to identify what will and what won't be included. Use this simple feature planning guide to help you.

- Ideally, we will include two players. Player 1 moves using the arrows keys, and player 2 moves using w, a, s, d keys. The player's plane will have enough resistance to resist 3 shots from the enemy. Each enemy the player defeat will give to him a certain amount of points depending on the type of enemy defeated. We will not create different levels. The whole game will be on the same level. 

### What is your timeline? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to review the rest of the course schedule together.

- This week we are planning the game. On week 10 we will release the alpha version of the game. On week 11 we will release the beta version of the game. On week 12 we will release a candidate version of the game. On week 13 we will finally release a stable version of the game.
